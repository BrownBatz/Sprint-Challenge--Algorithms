#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) because it will have a static amount of operations per data point


b) O(c^n) because for each point of data there will be 2 loops that run on it. So it would be O(2^n) specifically.


c) O(n) because it will only do one action per point of data
